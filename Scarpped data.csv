"Counting on Modi: these stocks fell on election anxiety, rose with exit polls
There are a few stocks whose fortunes in the stock market  are tied to the electoral luck of the current Prime Minister and government. These stocks - Adani group companies, as well as Anil Ambani group companies and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance, are almost a proxy for worry about Modi winning, and then growing confidence that his party will pull through the elections with a majority. 

These companies share prices have tracked closely together in the last month. Share prices responded ito worry about the opposition making gains and the drumbeat for coverage of opposition parties during the election cycle, falling sharply during the 6th phase of voting on May 13 and 14, and the tussle between political parties around conducting rallies in West Bengal - considered a crucial state for the BJP to win if it is to make up for seat losses in UP. 

Based on previous trends, analysts say that these stocks are likely to rise sharply tomorrow in the event of a Modi and BJP victory.
